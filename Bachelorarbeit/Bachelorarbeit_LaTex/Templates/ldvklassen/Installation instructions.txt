The LDV LaTeX Classes
======================================================================

This document describes the installation of the LDV LaTeX classes for
the LaTeX distributions MikTeX on Windows and TeX Live on Linux/Unix.


MikTeX on Windows
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The basic steps of installation are to firstly extract the archive in
a local or private TEXMF tree and to secondly update the filename
database. You can do this with the following steps:

  1. Extract the ZIP archive. A directory ldvklassen is created.

  2. Copy this directory to C:\Program Files.

  3. Start the application "MikTeX Options"
     (Start -> Programs -> MikTeX 2.8 -> Maintenance -> Settings).

  4. Go to the tab "Roots"

  5. Choose "Add..." and select the folder 
     C:\Program Files\ldvklassen.

  6. Choose "OK" twice to agree with the settings.
 

TeX Live on Linux/Unix
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The basic steps of installation are to firstly extract the archive in
a local or private TEXMF tree and to secondly update the filename
database. The install.sh script does this for you. So, perform the 
following two steps:

  1. Extract the ZIP archive. For example, type
      
       unzip ldvklassen.zip
      
     on the command line. A directory ldvklassen is created.
    
  2. Execute the script install.sh within this directory as root. For
     example, type
      
       sudo ldvklassen/install.sh
      
     on the command line.
